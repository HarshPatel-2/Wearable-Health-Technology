## Background:

Wearable health technology has the potential to significantly enhance patient care through precise activity tracking. This research aims to optimize the Human Activity Recognition Transformer (HART) model to improve both the accuracy and efficiency of recognizing daily activities. By utilizing datasets such as the [Inertia Sensors for Human Activity Recognition](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/owenagius/inertia-sensors-for-human-activity-recognition/data) and the [Human Activity Recognition (HAR) Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/har-1), the HART model will be fine-tuned and integrated into a WearOS application.

The datasets will be meticulously preprocessed, including steps like data cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering, to ensure high-quality inputs for the model. The performance of the HART model will be rigorously evaluated using key metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The ultimate goal is to create a user-friendly tool capable of accurately detecting and displaying ten distinct daily activities.

The initial testing phase will focus on deploying the application on wearable devices for use by healthy individuals, with plans for future testing involving participants with specific health conditions, such as Parkinson's disease. This research seeks to advance wearable health technology in healthcare by providing an accessible and reliable solution for activity monitoring.
